PeerTorPeer (PTP)
===

A proof-of-concept prototyping library for peer-to-peer
apps using Tor and Tor hidden services for connectivity.
 
Good starting points:

* the examples, especially `edu.kit.tm.ptp.examples.PTPSendExample`
* the JUnit tests, especially `edu.kit.tm.ptp.test.PTPTest`
* javadoc (generate it yourself please)

*WORK IN PROGRESS*
